# Summary

1. Volha, Syrchyna.
2.	My contact info:
  - phone: +375447373750
  - e-mail: olg.iurist@yandex.ru
3.	My goal is to build a career Frontend development. I work a lot, do self-training and self-development. I like to work in a team. Despite the lack of experience in this area, I am confident that I will succeed. In wishes to the future employer, I am not whimsical. Working conditions also do not matter. Today, development in this area is very important for me, because I am a purposeful person and always achieve my goal. I want to become Frontend developers, in the first place to prove to myself that you can change life at any of its stages.
4. My programming skills are quite modest. But to do my current job, I hab to lear a lot of sofware stuff like *MS office*, and many others, so my learning skills are on a good level i think.
5. My code example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ru">
  <head>
    <title>Sample</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <p>Заголовок</p>
      <nav>
        <a href="index.html">ссылка</a>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        <article>
            <h1>Заголовок1</h1>
            <p>Текст...</p>
            <img src="files/portrait.png" height="250" alt="ссылка">
        </article>
      <aside>
        Боковая панель
      </aside>
    </main>
    <footer>

    </footer>
  </body>
</html>

```

6. Unfortuale, I haven't had programming experetience for the last 12 years. Recently, I walked a few steps in the interactive **HTML** and **CSS** courses of the [HTML academy](https://htmlacademy.ru/courses).
7. In 2017, I graduated from Minsk Innovation University with a degree in law.
8. I have a basic level of English. Unfortunately, I've hardly had some real practice in English so far. But I started to study on my own and plan to impove my English.
